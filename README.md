# Welcome!
Hey, welcome to Grown From The Ashes! I'm "Designed In Ash", but I usually just go by "Ash".
The organization and its owning company (owned by me) is mainly focused on making games, especially those revolving around mental health, culture, or other interesting human-centric stories!
However, I have some open-source projects I've been working on that I hope can be of use to others! So, any open-source projects I decide to release under the company's name will be released here.
If you've got questions, concerns, or anything you wanna tell me, don't be afraid to reach out! I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
